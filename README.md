# Peaks

Welcome to the Peaks project!  

This project provides Docker images and scripts to create suitable build environments for building various PHYTEC BSPs. 

Because building BSPs can be a mountain of a task this project is codenamed 'Peaks' and each build environment will be on a branch using a mountain peak name. 

Each peak will be based on an existing Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, etc.). This is done because updating host distributions can break builds (due to various package changes).

Each branch will have a list of supported BSPs and tested machine and image types. Note that not all machines and images are tested in each build environment. 

## How to get started?
Currently, there is only one distribution available, Rainier. You can checkout (or switch here) the Rainier branch read how to get started. 

## Issues?

If you have issues, questions, etc. please create them in GitHub for this project!
